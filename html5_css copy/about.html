<p>You are not alone, even when the weight you’re carrying feels impossibly heavy. There are people who care deeply about your safety, your well‑being, and your future. Reaching out for support is not a sign of weakness. it’s an act of courage, and there are individuals, peers, professionals, and entire communities ready to stand beside you. In moments of struggle, connection can be a lifeline, and there is always someone willing to listen, to help you navigate the hard moments, and to remind you that your life has value. You don’t have to go through any of this by yourself.
