    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups sliced fresh peaches (about 6-7 medium peaches)</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the sliced peaches, 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and lemon juice. Toss until the peaches are well coated. Pour the peach mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the melted butter and milk, stirring until just combined. The batter will be thick.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of the batter over the peach mixture in the baking dish. It doesn't need to cover all the peaches; it will spread as it bakes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the topping comes out clean. Let it cool slightly before serving. Enjoy with a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired!</li>
