            <h3>My Story</h3>

            <p>My name is Matthew Foust and I have always had a passion for cooking. Growing up in the south, I was exposed to a variety of delicious dishes that inspired me to dream of pursue a career in the culinary arts. After years of cooking for my family and friends and honing my skills, I have dreamed of opening my own restaurant to share my love of southern cuisine with others. Foust Southern Kitchen is the culmination of my dreams and hard work, that I hope will bring joy to all who visit when i decide to follow that dream in twenty years once i retire from corrections.</p>

<p>
what i would say if it was a real place and not a dream i have always had is that we are committed to using locally sourced ingredients whenever possible, supporting local farmers and producers. Our menu features a variety of classic southern dishes, including fried chicken, shrimp and grits, collard greens, and cornbread. We also offer a selection of homemade desserts, such as pecan pie and banana pudding. At Foust Southern Kitchen, we strive to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere where our customers can enjoy delicious food and create lasting memories with their loved ones.
