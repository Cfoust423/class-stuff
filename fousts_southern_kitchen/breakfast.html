<h2>
    Kissin' biscuits
</h2>
<p>
   Kisses biscuits are soft, fluffy biscuits baked close together in a pan, causing them to touch or "kiss" as they rise in the oven. These biscuits eliminate the need for rolling out dough, since they're scooped instead of cut. Lightly tossing them in flour before baking helps prevent them from fully sticking together, ensuring a pull-apart texture.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (2 oz.) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-in. pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup whole buttermilk, chilled</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy whipping cream, chilled</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Coat an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray; set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter or 2 forks, cut butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Create a well in center of the flour mixture and add buttermilk, heavy cream, and honey; stir together until dry ingredients are moistened and mixture resembles a thick batter.</li>
        <li>Fill a shallow bowl with additional flour (about 1/2 cup). Using a 1/3-cup measuring cup (or a 2 3/4 oz. scoop) scoop a portion of batter into the bowl of flour, gently tossing until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Shake off excess flour and transfer to prepared baking pan. Repeat with remaining dough, arranging in 3 even rows of 3 each, leaving no space between portions of dough. Discard any remaining flour.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until tops are golden brown and biscuits are cooked through, 25 to 27 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool in pan for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>
    Buttermilk pancakes
</h2>

<p>
    Buttermilk pancakes are a classic breakfast treat known for their fluffy texture and rich flavor. Made with buttermilk, these pancakes have a slight tanginess that complements the sweetness of syrup or toppings. The acidity in buttermilk helps to tenderize the batter, resulting in light and airy pancakes that are perfect for a comforting morning meal.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together buttermilk, egg, and melted butter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings such as syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
